# Hazard Harbinger: Precise Prescription Burning Area Localization via a LiDAR-mounted Drone and System of Embedded Nodes

## Introduction  
	Wildfires are major environmental disasters with far-reaching consequences on 
the environment and human mortality. A common practice to prevent wildfires is 
prescribed burning, which requires thorough planning. To aid these burn plans, we 
propose a novel system that integrates an airborne LiDAR system and deployable sensor 
nodes. This system will result in 3D models and relevant environmental data.
